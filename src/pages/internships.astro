Primarily worked on networking tests(Layer 2/3 latency/throughput/configs) and custom bootloaders for Space and Terrestrial Deployments. Additionally, setup in house FPGA Dev infra from scratch and worked on Forward-Error-Correction(FEC) for the 10G Ethernet Design. Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of hardware components with embedded software, enhancing overall system performance and scalability.\n\n On a side note, became super proficient in using fancy coffee machines(the office had 4 of them!)',
